## When and where?

We will meet on Friday, June 17th 2022 at 18:00 pm CEST (German time) at the
end of the bridge in the Stadtgarten in Freiburg. Afterwards we will sit with
picnic blankets somewhere in the park, so even if you are late you can try
finding us. We will carry a cardboard sign saying "www.rationality-freiburg.de"
. The meetup will finish at 20:00 pm CEST and we may go to get dinner
afterwards. In case of very bad weather we will look for an alternative venue,
so please watch this site for updates or get in touch beforehand so we can
reach out.

## What will we do?

We will **discuss** the first three posts from the sequence [Fake
Beliefs](https://www.readthesequences.com/Fake-Beliefs-Sequence) of [Book I:
Map and Territory](https://www.readthesequences.com/Book-I-Map-And-Territory)
of **"The Sequences"**, a _standard compendium_ of the Rationality community.

* [Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences)](https://www.readthesequences.com/Making-Beliefs-Pay-Rent-In-Anticipated-Experiences)
* [A Fable of Science and Politics](https://www.readthesequences.com/A-Fable-Of-Science-And-Politics)
* [Belief in Belief](https://www.readthesequences.com/Belief-In-Belief)

It would be ideal if you read this beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post.

Afterwards we will **play a game of double crux**. Double crux is an exercise
done in pairs where the goal is first to find an issue where you have a
disagreement and then identify the fundamental root cause of that disagreement.
It's not about confrontation or discussing the issue, but **collaborating** to
find that _crux_ that is making you disagree. For example two
people might disagree on wearing sandals with socks. After some collaborating
they find that the crux of their disagreement is how much importance they
assign to following tacit social norms. They could then dig even deeper why
these social norms are important or why they feel important. As preparation
you can think of a few _controversial_ beliefs you may have, so that it will be
quick to find a source of disagreement with your randomly assigned partner.

There will be snacks and drinks.


## What is this about?

Rationality Freiburg is a meeting place for LessWrong or SCC readers as well as
other people interested in Rationality. Rationality is the desire to see the
world as it is, in particular using empirical sciences as well as the
development of tools for reaching personal goals.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

Feel free to just turn up, but if you want to reach out or RSVP that would be
even better info@rationality-freiburg.de .

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

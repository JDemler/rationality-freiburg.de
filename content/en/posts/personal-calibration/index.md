When I say I'm 80% sure I will have that project done by Friday, what do I mean
by that? What I should mean is that in 8 out of 10 similar situations I would
be done by Friday and in 2 out of 10 I would not.

In reality people are frequently miscalibrated. When they say 80% it in fact
turns out that only in 5 out of 10 similar projects they would be done by the
predicted date.

When I ask you whether Brasil or China has a bigger landmass you might say
"China". Then I ask "How certain are you?". You might reply 80%.

What do you mean by that? What you should mean is that given similar questions
you would get 8 out 10 right and 2 wrong.

 In fact given similar questions people frequently would only get 5 out of 10
 right. Meaning that they are miscalibrated. They don't properly estimate their
 own confidence.
 
Why is that bad? You might take a bet that you shouldn't. You might defend some
position because you are not asking your own gut how sure you *really* are
about that argument you are using.

Knowing yourself and assessing whether you can trust your intuitions or whether
you shouldn't is a valuable skill.

The good news is that personal calibration can be trained really well. The bad
news is that it only transfers moderately well to other domains. So even if you
become very well calibrated for trivia questions you might not automatically
see an improvement in task estimation at work.

Here is an example how the sheet can be filled out, with an interpretation.

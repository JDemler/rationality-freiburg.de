summary: Our second _Rationality Freiburg_ meetup took place on June 3rd and
   shone a lot of light on the topic of rationality despite the gloomy weather
   forecast.

_What is rationality?_ This was the overarching question that kept our group of
11 people thinking and discussing last Friday in the Freiburger Stadtgarten.
Half of us were newcomers, but all members came from Freiburg and its vicinity.

Soon after we gathered in the Stadtgarten, Omar opened up the discussion about
the first blog-posts in the [Predictably Wrong
Sequence](https://www.readthesequences.com/Predictably-Wrong-Sequence).  The
discussion branched out into many related topics, such as the role of
rationality in morality, its interplay with feelings and the rationality in
System 1 and 2 as defined by [Thinking Fast and
Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow).

Following the discussion, we took a calibration quiz in which answers are given
together with a subjective confidence, similar to [Confidence
Calibration](http://confidence.success-equation.com/).  The quiz helped us to
uncover and correct biases in our confidence.

To round off the event, we went for some dinner in the city center and ended up
at the persian restaurant Shahaneh where discussions about rationality
continued on a more light-hearted note. As the sun went down, so did also the
quality of the discussed topics. Nevertheless, it was the perfect time and
place to discuss the latest news in the Heard vs Depp trial. Turns out rational
people also have guilty pleasures üòÑÔ∏è

We are all looking forward to the next meeting, this time with you there as well!

## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Rationality?

The desire to see the world as it really is, not as you want it to be. This
means having an open mind, learning about human cognitive biases and how to
work around them as well as applying the scientific method (hypothesis +
experiment).

### Are human emotions bad?

No. Emotions and gut feelings are an integral part of the human experience and
in fact vital for our survival. Seeing the world as it really is also implies
seeing humans as they really are. Only in some situations emotions and
intuitions can mislead us and it would be useful to recognize those situations
and improve the results of our decisions.

### Is this group affiliated with a political party or entity?

No.

### Is this group a cult/sect?

No. But remember that [every cause wants to be a
cult](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yEjaj7PWacno5EvWa/every-cause-wants-to-be-a-cult),
so we encourage you to always stay skeptical.

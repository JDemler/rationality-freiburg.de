## Organization

We will sit with picnic blankets somewhere in the park, so even if you are late
you can try finding us. We will carry a cardboard sign saying "Rationality
Freiburg". After the meetup we may go to get dinner.

In case of very bad weather we will look for an alternative venue, so please
watch this site for updates or get in touch beforehand so we can reach out.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

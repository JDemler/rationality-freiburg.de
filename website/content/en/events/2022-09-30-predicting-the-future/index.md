## Organization

The place for the meetup is still undecided, but it will be some central
location in Freiburg. Please check back later.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!


## What will we do?

We will discuss predicting the future.

Please read the following as preparation, but do come even if you don't!

* [If It’s Worth Doing, It’s Worth Doing With Made-Up Statistics](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/)
* [Ten Commandments for Aspiring Superforecasters](https://fs.blog/ten-commandments-for-superforecasters/)

**Optional reading**:

* [Podcast interview with Philip Tetlock (46 minutes)](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/philip-tetlock/)
  or his book ["Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction"](https://www.amazon.de/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/1847947158/)
* [Prediction Markets (Gwern)](https://www.gwern.net/Prediction-markets)
* [Introduction to Prediction Markets, Robin Hanson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yZKGbq1YmA) (video, 18 minutes)

After discussing predictions and probabilities we will turn to practice:

* Make concrete personal predictions for the near future and resolve to track the results
* Try out [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/) and [Manifold
  Markets](https://manifold.markets/). If you already create an account on
  those platforms before the meetup it would be great! If possible bring a
  smartphone or a laptop.

There will be snacks and drinks.

## Organization

The place for the meetup is still undecided, but it will be some central
location in Freiburg. Please check back later.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

Maybe you also want to join the [hike]({{< ref
"/events/2022-10-15-hike-with-karlsruhe-rationality" >}}) on the day after this
event!

## What will we do?

First there will be one or several (depending on the number of people) free
discussion rounds. I suggest everyone prepares one or two [SSC (Slate Star
Codex)](https://slatestarcodex.com/) or [ACX (Astral Codex
Ten)](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) posts they particularly enjoy. You
can then give a short summary of the post and the discussion can flow from
there.

If you need inspiration check the [SSC top
posts](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/).

After the discussion we will play "The Falling Drill".

One of the most important parts of intellectual progress is learning to change
your mind. The first step of changing your mind is realizing that you were
wrong about something. Today we're going to practice that often painful
realization, in a small way and in a low pressure situation. Without this
skill, how can you debate an important issue or confront a challenging topic?
You might argue long after it's clear to others that you've lost, because
admitting it feels like defeat.

The first lesson any martial artist learns is often how to fall. There are ways
to make the landing easier, but they all start from the knowledge that falling
isn't the worst thing in the world.

There will be snacks and drinks. After the event we will go and get dinner
somewhere.

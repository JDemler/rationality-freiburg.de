**UPDATE 24.09:** Please note that this event was postponed from October 1st to
October 15th!

You may also want to join the [ACX meetup]({{< ref
"/events/2022-10-14-acx-astral-codex-ten-meetup" >}}) on the evening before
this hike!

This will be a joint event with [Karlsruhe
Rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R).

We will meet at the Schwabentor, then hike up to Roßkopf, from there to St.
Ottilien where depending on the weather we can stay to have a drink or eat and
then back to the starting point.

The entire tour will be about 11 km (6.8 miles) with 550 meters (1800 feet)
elevation gain and the same in elevation loss.

At a leisurely pace it will take us 4 - 5 hours.

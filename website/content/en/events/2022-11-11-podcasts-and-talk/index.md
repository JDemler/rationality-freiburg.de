## Content
This is a social style event. You can come and go as it fits you.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!
In doubt we split up the groups into a German and an English part.

## Preparation
2-5 Minutes presentation of a podcast of your choise, optional,

## What will we do?
Tell us about your favorite podcast (2-5 Minutes). Preferably a rationality oriented one, but if you have one that you might think is good for this audience, just share it.
I want this part to start 18:15 and we will see how long it takes.

Afterwards just hang around with fellow rationalists and have a nice talk.

There will be snacks and drinks.

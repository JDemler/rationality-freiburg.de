## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

## Preparation

Read these three posts from the sequence "Noticing Confusion", of Book I: Map
and Territory of "The Sequences".

* [How Much Evidence Does It Take?](https://www.readthesequences.com/How-Much-Evidence-Does-It-Take)
* [Einstein’s Arrogance](https://www.readthesequences.com/Einsteins-Arrogance)
* [Occam’s Razor](https://www.readthesequences.com/Occams-Razor)

Optional: Read pages 44 to 56 of the [CFAR
Handbook](https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf).


## What will we do?

It would be ideal to read the three posts beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post with a discussion in the meeting.

Afterwards, we will give an introduction to TAPs (Trigger-Action-Plan). TAPs
are a technique to create a new intentional habit or break an unwanted habit to
achieve specific goals.

TAP focuses on a specific noteworthy external trigger which leads to a very
small action. It uses our knowledge from the standard habit model; the
intentions are implemented with an 'if-then' strategy, while a response is
paired with an external trigger.

In the meeting, we will split the group into pairs, and two people will discuss
and collaborate to develop a personal TAP to achieve a specific goal in the
days after the meetup. We will compare the results and experience in
implementing TAPs in a follow-up meetup.

There will be snacks and drinks.

## Preparation

You can get a headstart by reading the following posts on lesswrong.com about
cognitive biases. 

* [Biases: An Introduction](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi/biases-an-introduction)
* [What cognitive biases feel like from the inside](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ERWeEA8op6s6tYCKy/what-cognitive-biases-feel-like-from-the-inside)


## What will we do?

Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts people use to make sense of the world
around them. In other words, these shortcuts or tendencies our brains use to
process information more efficiently. While they can be helpful in some
situations, they can also lead to systematic errors in thinking and
decision-making. These biases can lead people to make judgments that are not
necessarily accurate or fair, affecting how people perceive, interpret,
remember, and ultimately make decisions.

At the beginning of this meetup, a short presentation will be followed by
discussions about cognitive biases. This exercise aims to learn more about
biases and build strategies on how to avoid them.

Following the discussion about cognitive biases, we will play some serious
games about the same topic. Well, no need to get scared by the name; serious
games are also fun games that are designed for a specific purpose and not only
for entertainment. They are often used for educational purposes or to convey
information.

There will be snacks and drinks.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

## Preparation

Read the following texts:

* [Nobody Is Perfect, Everything Is
  Commensurable](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/)
* [The Cambist and Lord Iron: A Fairy Tale of
  Economics](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/)

## What will we do?

We will discuss the two texts, play a game called "Cambist Booking" and discuss
"Units of Exchange" and their applicability to our lives.

The "Cambist Booking" game goes like this: each person will get a some cards
with things you might want on them. You’ll go around asking other people what
their cards are, and deciding how to compare the two values – is a sportscar
worth more or less than a year’s vacation? Is an hour long massage worth more
or less than a new album by your favourite band? We’ll pass out the cards at
the start, keeping some in reserve for new arrivals, and spend the time talking
about what we value and why. 

The lessons taught in Units of Exchange are direct applications of extremely
well- established principles from economics and sociology, such as supply and
demand, Pareto curves, value of information, the sunk cost fallacy, and
arbitrage.

There will be snacks and drinks.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

Note that the event is on a Saturday instead of the usual Friday!

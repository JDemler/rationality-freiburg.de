## Preparation

You can get a headstart by reading the following posts on lesswrong.com.

* [A compilation of misuses of statistics](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d9MkMeLWvoDEsqpQP/a-compilation-of-misuses-of-statistics)
* [Biases: An Introduction](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi/biases-an-introduction)


## What will we do?

We will continue our discussion on Bayesian thinking while navigating decisions
and how it can help us to avoid many cognitive biases. At the beginning of this
meetup, we will briefly discuss about cognitive biases and Bayes' rule with
some examples.  You are welcome to bring your personal experience in these two
topics. Followed by that, we will discuss how statistics can be misused to
trick our brains.

A mathematical background is not necessary, and the goal is to make the subject
very intuitive and simple.

Following the discussion about cognitive biases, we will play some games about
the related topics with the educational purpose of conveying information.

There will be snacks and drinks!!!


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

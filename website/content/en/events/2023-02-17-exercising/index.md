## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

The talk will explain what happens in our body when we are exercising. From
this we will draw conclusions on how to get the maximum positiv effect out of
our invested time. Spoiler alert: To go jogging three times a week for one hour
each is both, highly ineffective, and not enough. The good news is that we can
do better in less time.

This talk is for all who are not into exercising at all up to now but might
also be interesting for others, who want to improve their understanding of the
matter and their efficiency.

After the talk we will discuss some of the ideas presented and then split into
pairs. Each person in the pair will make a commitment concerning exercise for
the next week and for the next month to the other person. Some form of
communication will be established and each person can then report to their
partner whether they were successful or not after the week/month has passed.

There will be snacks and drinks.


## Organization

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out! The slides themselves
will be in German, though.

The meetup will be hosted by Matthias.

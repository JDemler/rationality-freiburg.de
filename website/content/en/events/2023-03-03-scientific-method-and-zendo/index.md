## What will we do?

We will explain and debate the scientific method and science.

Then we will explain how the scientific method relates to the game Zendo and
play several rounds of that game.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

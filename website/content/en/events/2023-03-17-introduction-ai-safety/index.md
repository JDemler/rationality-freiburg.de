## Preparation

To be defined.


## What will we do?

We will hear a beginner-friendly talk on AI (Artificial Intelligence) safety by
robotics researcher [Benjamin Alt](https://benjaminalt.github.io/).

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Benjamin.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to

## What will we do?

Free will is the belief that individuals have agency and control over their own
actions, and that they can choose to act or not act in a given situation. It is
the ability to make choices and decisions that are not predetermined by factors
outside of oneself. The concept of free will has been debated by philosophers,
theologians, and scientists for centuries, with some arguing that it is an
illusion while others believe it is essential to our understanding of human
behavior and responsibility. Ultimately, the nature and existence of free will
remain a topic of ongoing debate and discussion. Are we free to choose? Why do
we do the things we do? We will have a friendly discussion about this topic.

After the discussion we will play "The Noticing Game". Two people stand or sit
directly across from each other, making eye contact. One person is A and the
other is B.  A goes first. A begins: "Sitting/standing here with you, I
notice…" B responds, "Hearing that, I notice…". It is a deceptively simple but
powerful exercise.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Catarina.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

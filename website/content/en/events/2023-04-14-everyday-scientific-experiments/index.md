## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Science or the scientific method is not something reserved for people with
white coats in laboratories. Rather, it is a way of thinking you can apply to
your life each and every day.

We will discuss ways of applying the scientific method and then design concrete
experiments people can run on their own. Such experiments could involve
gardening (which plants grow best in what kind of soil or light?), your cooking
(what method is best for getting the perfect boiled potatoe?), people (how will
colleagues react to different kinds of snacks at different times of the day?),
your own mood or psychological state (how does your evening activity affect how
you feel when waking up?), the effect of taking Vitamin D, ...


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

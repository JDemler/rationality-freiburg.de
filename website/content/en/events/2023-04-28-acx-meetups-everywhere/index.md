## Preparation

Select one or two [SSC (Slate Star Codex)](https://slatestarcodex.com/) or [ACX
(Astral Codex Ten)](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) posts that you
particularly enjoy so you can give a short summary to other participants.

If you need inspiration check the [SSC top
posts](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/).


## What will we do?

This will be mostly a social event. We will discuss a few of the posts in small
groups and enjoy the company.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

## Preparation

Select one or two [SSC (Slate Star Codex)](https://slatestarcodex.com/) or [ACX
(Astral Codex Ten)](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) posts that you
particularly enjoy so you can give a short summary to other participants.

If you need inspiration check the [SSC top
posts](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/).


## What will we do?

We will discuss a few of the posts in small groups.

Then we will do a "Small Identity" exercise.

Our identity is a very interesting phenomenon. We seem to carry an idea in our
head about who we are, what kind of person we are and what that means about us.
Identity is both valuable and dangerous at various times. Identity comes from
our history and our experiences. It is both our scars and the ideas we would
die on a hill for.

In some senses the identity of being "righteous person" might net you all kinds
of rewards and guidance in situations where you have to decide to "do the right
thing"...  BUUT it might also lead you to kill people in the name of your
religion.

Paul Graham says, ["keep your identity
small"](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html). The book "Transform yourself"
includes some guidance to change your identity or your beliefs about yourself.
The main exercise is from Psychiatrist Irvin Yalom but is a mix of those
resources and a few more.

This exercise is to help us to be comfortable shedding things that are part of
our identity. If they are no longer useful.

It is hard to think clearly about parts of your identity. To grow, you must
change. Let things go when they don't work for you.

The idea for the exercise and the above description are from
[Eliot](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elo), who organizes meetups and
workshops in Sydney, Australia.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

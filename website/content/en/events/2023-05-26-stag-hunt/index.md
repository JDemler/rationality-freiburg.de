## Preparation

Read the following post:

* [The Schelling Choice is "Rabbit", not
  "Stag"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zp5AEENssb8ZDnoZR/the-schelling-choice-is-rabbit-not-stag).


## What will we do?

The Stag Hunt is a bit of game theory, similar to the more popularly known
Prisoner's Dilemma. The idea is that a group of hunters are going out, and they
can either cooperate to hunt Stag for a large benefit that only works if
everyone chooses it, or individually hunt Rabbit for a small benefit that works
even if not everyone agrees. Cooperation is harder than we think; not everybody
is always on the same page about what we’re trying to do. Staggering Hunters is
a gamified version of this! We’re going to play the game, then discuss how it
went and try again to see if we can do better.

We will discuss the post linked above and the implications for our own lives.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

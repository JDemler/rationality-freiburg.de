## Preparation

Read:

* [Scientific, Legal, and Rational evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fhojYBGGiYAFcryHZ/scientific-evidence-legal-evidence-rational-evidence)
* [Fake Explanations](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5uZQHpecjn7955faL/p/fysgqk4CjAwhBgNYT)


## What will we do?

“I ask you the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you believe what you
believe?”

There are lots of things we think are true. Many of them are actually true! In
this meetup, we’re going to state some beliefs about the world and then step
through why we hold that this is true – or if we disagree, why we hold that
this is false! We’ll list our reasons, and then consider whether those reasons
are credible. The intention is to practice on easy targets, but that doesn’t
mean that the easy answers of “well everyone knows that” or “it's obvious” are
going to pass!


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

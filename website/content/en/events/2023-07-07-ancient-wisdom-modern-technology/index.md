## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Delve into the mystical depths of Daoism, the frontiers of Artificial
Intelligence, and the mysteries of consciousness with our enlightening
30-minute interactive talk!

Discover how the ancient philosophy of Daoism - with its tenets of harmony,
balance, and intuitive action - can illuminate the pathways of AI development.
Imagine an AI that's not just algorithmically advanced but also adaptable and
intuitive - an embodiment of Daoist principles!

Ever wondered about the role of 'attention' in shaping human consciousness?
We'll explore how this fundamental driver could be the missing link to creating
human-like consciousness in AI. 

Our exploration doesn't end there! Embark on a journey into the realm of
phenomenology, the study of human experience. Uncover the profound implications
of this philosophical discipline on how AI could interact with, learn from, and
perhaps even understand the world.

Join us for this incredible intersection of philosophy, meditation, and
advanced technology. Ideal for philosophers, meditation experts, and graduate
students, but open to anyone with a thirst for knowledge. Enlighten your mind,
broaden your horizons, and embrace the future of AI through the lens of ancient
wisdom! Don't miss this unique opportunity!

After the presentation we will split into one or multiple discussion rounds to
talk about the ideas that were presented.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Matt.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

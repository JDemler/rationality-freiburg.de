## Preparation

To be defined.


## What will we do?

Omar is attending a 10-day AI (Artificial Intelligence) Safety bootcamp i.e.
how do we ensure that AI does not threaten humanity and human values. He will
give a talk about what he learned. The talk will be beginner-friendly.
Afterwards there will be a discussion round.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

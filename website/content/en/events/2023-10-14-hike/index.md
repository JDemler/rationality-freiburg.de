## What will we do?

Meeting place is at 10:00 a.m. on platform 7 (check whether there is a change
for S1) at Freiburg main train station.  Please arrive earlier if you need a
ticket and/or want to discuss buying a group ticket. We will take the S1 to
Kirchzarten (leaves at 10:10 a.m.) and from there a bus to St. Märgen.

The hike will start in St. Märgen shortly after 11 a.m. and we will walk to
Zweribach-Wasserfälle and from there back to St. Märgen. It's a total of 14.3
km with 530m of elevation change. According to Komoot the difficulty is
"intermediate" and it should take around 4:45 hours. We will take breaks on the
way.

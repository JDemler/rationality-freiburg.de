## Preparation

None


## What will we do?

Matthias will give a talk and afterwards we will have a discussion round on the
topics presented. This is part 2 out of 2. If you missed the first part you
might be a little lost, but feel free to come anyway.

There are many obvious ways to reduce your environmental footprint: Eating less
meat, not using planes or combustion engines, etc. You all know these, so we
will not talk about them. Instead, we will explore some less obvious ideas.

If you do already all the obvious things, this talk is definitely for you. If
you do not do all the obvious things, this talk might also be interesting for
you because most of the things in this talk will save some of your money. Many
of them without any (significant) reduction of your life quality.



## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out! The slides themselves
will be in German, though.

This meetup will be hosted by Matthias.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

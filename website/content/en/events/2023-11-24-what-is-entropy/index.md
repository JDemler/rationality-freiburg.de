## Update 2023-12-05

The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xPzCcCEZeIwwxhStp5ifctFvSjwHaL4Sn2XPsQWwxbg/edit).


## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Entropy is a fundamental concept in physics that has wide ranging applications
within as well as outside of physics.

In this talk Nawid is going to shine a light on this very elusive concept and
(try to) explain it in an intuitive way. Goal of this talk is to leave with a
better understanding of ideas related to information theory, the arrow of time
or the heat death of the universe.

The talk will either include interactive exercises or there will be a
discussion round afterwards.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Nawid.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

## Update 2023-12-10

* Slides: [2023-12-08 Anki Optimize Your Learning.pdf](<2023-12-08 Anki Optimize Your Learning.pdf>)
* Anki deck for essential concepts: [RatFr Anki Basics - v2.apkg](<RatFr Anki Basics - v2.apkg>)
  * v2: Export in different format to make it compatible with older Anki versions


## Preparation

I **strongly recommend** you do the following things. Nevertheless, I will
assume some people have not done them and give time and instructions to do it
during the meetup. So even if you don't have time to prepare, come anyway! Why
should you do it before? Because it's not the same having 20% of people needing
assistance during the live setup than having 100%.

* Bring an **electronic device** to the event, either a laptop, an Android
  phone/tablet or an iPhone/iPad. If you have no device you can participate by
  using paper flashcards that I'll provide or collaborate with someone that has
  an electronic device.
* **Install Anki** (Windows/Linux/macOS/Android/iOS) on the device you are
  bringing: https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download (Note that the iOS app for
  iPhone/iPad costs $25 - money well spent so I encourage you to buy it - but
  everything else is free).
* If Anki is already installed please ensure you **update** to the latest
  version (for PC 23.10.1, AnkiDroid for Android 2.16.5, AnkiMobile for iOS
  23.10)
* **Sign up** for AnkiWeb (free): https://ankiweb.net/account/signup

**Optional** additional preparation:

* Read about some key concepts:
  https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#key-concepts
* Very thorough article on spaced repetition including data and research:
  https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition
* Michael Nielsen (a famous quantum physicist and computer scientist) explains
  how he uses Anki (e.g. to read research papers) and gives background
  information. This article probably motivated myself to get started with Anki
  a few years ago. https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html


## What will we do?

I have been using Anki for 1279 days, every day (ok, I missed around 10 days
total). That's 3 and a half years. It has been one of the single most
significant improvements in my life.

I will explain what spaced repetition is, how it works and how you can leverage
it to remember anything you want to remember for as long as you want to.
Memorization has a bad reputation but in fact every thought and creative
insight you have, uses memories stored in your brain. Reading a book and being
able to remember the core ideas years down the line is valuable. Attaching
names to concepts is valuable. I will show many concrete examples of how and
why I use Anki, pitfalls where I ran into difficulties and lessons I learnt.

Last but not least I will guide you in starting using Anki during the meetup.
You will install it on your device (if at all possible, please do this before
the meetup, see the "Preparation" section above). You will then take a piece of
text and convert it into good Anki cards. Creating Anki cards is easy. Creating
good cards is hard. Your success will hinge in making a habit out of using Anki
and on having great cards.

What can you use Anki for? For studying any subject (school, university,
privately). To summarize books, articles or research papers. To test yourself
on small exercises. Some examples from my collection:

* Names of people, using their photographs
* Food allergies, names of children and spouses of friends
* Small mathematical exercises (e.g. what is the derivative of f(x) = (3-6x)^5?
  Two cards will be dealt off the top of a well-shuffled deck. What is the
  chance that the first card will be the seven of clubs and the second card
  will be the queen of hearts?)
* Important phone numbers
* Vocabulary and phrases in multiple languages
* Grammatical rules
* Correct spelling of words (e.g. desert/dessert, ocurred/occured/occurred)
* Meaning of words/expressions (e.g. gregarious, dichotomy, fatuous, to suss
  something out)
* Ingredients for favorite cooking recipes
* Computer shortcuts (e.g. how to drag the selected but hidden object in
  Inkscape?)
* Identifying keys, intervals and notes in sheet music
* Core ideas from books (e.g. from Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends & Influence
  People": Take care to [...] people’s names [...])
* ...


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

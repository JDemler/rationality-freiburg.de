## Preparation

Optional:
* Read the CFAR description of [Double
  Crux](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WLQspe83ZkiwBc2SR/double-crux)
* Excellent post by Scott Alexander on arguments/disagreements and their
  problems: [Varieties Of Argumentative
  Experience](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NLBbCQeNLFvBJJkrt)


## What will we do?

I will explain Double Crux, an exercise to collaboratively find the root of a
disagreement.

We will then identify some controversial topics where different people have
different opinions. People will then pair up and apply Double Crux. We will
shuffle the pairs a few times.

The goal of the evening is to walk away with a better understanding of your own
beliefs and to get more practice in having collaborative and constructive
discussion.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

> Friendly

> The discussion in the smaller group (though the group was still somewhat big)

> The exercise of fooling an outsider was great! The conclusion to our discussion about cult. It could have been more structured. Maybe with a voting at the end from 1 to 5 how cultish this group is.

> Small discussion group/ n/a

> Most- people least- nothing

> Most: The many views brought about by the different participants. The reading list.
> Least: the content felt not cohesive. Some consolidation could help.

> Am Besten die Übung, am wenigsten nichts.

> the structure with 3 levels of preparation was very good idea

> Was fun

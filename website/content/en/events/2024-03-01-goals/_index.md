## Preparation

There will be some texts to read which I'll add at the latest a week before the
event. Please check back here.


## What will we do?

We will discuss the texts linked above. The general topic will be achieving your
goals, procrastination and akrasia. People who have not read the texts
beforehand, will read them on-site and only start the discussion afterwards.

After the discussion, Omar will present the tool Beeminder and assist those who
want to give it a try in setting it up.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

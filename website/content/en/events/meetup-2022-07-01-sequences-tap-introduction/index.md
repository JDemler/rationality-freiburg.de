## When and where?

We will meet on Friday, July 1st 2022 at 18:00 pm CEST (German time) at the
end of the bridge in the Stadtgarten in Freiburg. Afterwards we will sit with
picnic blankets somewhere in the park, so even if you are late you can try
finding us. We will carry a cardboard sign saying "www.rationality-freiburg.de"
. The meetup will finish at 20:00 pm CEST and we may go to get dinner
afterwards. In case of very bad weather we will look for an alternative venue,
so please watch this site for updates or get in touch beforehand so we can
reach out.

## What will we do?

We will **discuss** the three posts from the sequence [Fake
Beliefs](https://www.readthesequences.com/Fake-Beliefs-Sequence) of [Book I:
Map and Territory](https://www.readthesequences.com/Book-I-Map-And-Territory)
of **"The Sequences"**, a _standard compendium_ of the Rationality community.

* [Bayesian Judo](https://www.readthesequences.com/Bayesian-Judo)
* [Pretending to be Wise](https://www.readthesequences.com/Pretending-To-Be-Wise)
* [Religionâ€™s Claim to be Non-Disprovable](https://www.readthesequences.com/Religions-Claim-To-Be-Non-Disprovable)

It would be ideal if you read this beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post.

Afterwards we will give an introduction to **TAPs (Trigger-Action Planning)**.
TAP is a technique for changing habits or reaching goals. You choose a very
specific external trigger and a very small action to do in reaction to that
trigger.

We will split into pairs and the partners will collaborate to develop a
personal TAP to implement in the days after the meetup.

In the meetup on [July 8th]({{< ref
"/events/meetup-2022-07-08-sequences-tap-result-discussion" >}}) we will
compare our experiences implementing TAPs.

As preparation you can read pages 44 to 56 of the [CFAR
Handbook](https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf).

There will be snacks and drinks.


## What is this about?

Rationality Freiburg is a meeting place for LessWrong or SSC readers as well as
other people interested in Rationality. Rationality is the desire to see the
world as it is, in particular using empirical sciences as well as the
development of tools for reaching personal goals.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

Feel free to just turn up, but if you want to reach out or RSVP that would be
even better info@rationality-freiburg.de .

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

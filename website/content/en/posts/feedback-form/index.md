# Update 2024-01-22

The forms have been updated. The online links below still work fine. To find
the PDF files (and the new Scribus sources) check the
[design/forms/](https://github.com/omarkohl/rationality-freiburg.de/tree/main/design/forms)
folder on GitHub.


# Original

To collect feedback from event participants we use a Google form in English and
German.

For participants who prefer not filling it out on their phone or PC we also
provide printed copies that are attached as PDFs below.

* [PDF: Feedback Overview](event-feedback-overview.pdf): This is meant for

  forms. The form key is meant to explain what the different answer options
  mean, in case it's not completely clear.

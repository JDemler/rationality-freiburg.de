Sunday morning. Armed with hiking boots and epistemic curiosity a car full of
aspiring Freiburger rationalists leaves the train station in Freiburg towards
Bad Herrenalb.

Marcus, one of the founders of the [Karlsruhe
group](https://www.lesswrong.com/groups/kw7Zb8DLmZtsK8g3R) had organized a
beautiful hike that was challenging and beginner friendly at the same time.

The group size was such that it was possible to frequently change conversation
partners and our walking speed were well matched as well as ideal for
conversing during the hike.

The inspiring topics we touched upon ranged from AI (artificial intelligence)
safety, meaningful and meaningless questions after the death of a loved one,
ethical implications of Covid triage in hospitals, what "beliefs" are all the
way to to model aeroplanes and how to measure energy efficience and heat
dissipation in your home.

During the break at the Teufelsmühle, Marcus unpacked a camping cooker, a
manual coffee grinder as well as a few other accessories and real espresso
cups!  While we enjoyed the excellent coffeee we, of course, discussed our
confidence in actually being able to taste the difference vs. pretentious BS.

After the hike was over, the evening tapered off with a piece of cake and a
round of coffee in one of the cafés in Bad Herrenalb. Is it good to give the
waiter the (polite) feedback that their coffee is really bad? What are the
consequences of doing so or not doing so? Even the simplest of questions must
be explored!

Next time, Freiburg!

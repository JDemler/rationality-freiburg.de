Early in the morning a car full of aspiring Freiburger rationalists left the train station in Freiburg towards Bad Herrenalb, near Karlsruhe.

Marcus, one of the founders of the Karlsruhe group had organized a beautiful hike that challenging enough and beginnern friendly at the same time.

The group size was such that it was possible to frequently change conversation partners and our walking speed were well matched as well as adequate for conversing during the hike.

The inspiring topics we touched upon ranged from AI (artificial intelligence) safety, meaningful and meaningless questions after the death of a loved one, ethical implications of Covid triage in hospital, what beliefs are to model aeroplanes and how to measure energy efficience and heat dissipation in your home.

During the break at the Teufelsmühle Marcus unpacked a camping cooker, a manual coffee grinder as well as a few other accessoires and proper espresso cups. While we enjoyed the excellent coffeee we of course discussed our confidence in actually being able to taste the difference vs. pretentious BS.

After the hike was over the evening was finished off with a piece of cake and a round of coffee in one of the cafés in Bad Herrenalb. Is it good to give the waiter the (polite) feedback that their coffee is really bad? What are the consequences of doing so or not doing so? Even the simplest of questions must be explored!

Next time we will meet in Freiburg!

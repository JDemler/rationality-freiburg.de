> I liked the „make the elephants like each other idea“

> Schade war, dass viel Zeit dafür verwendet wurde Dinge zu wiederholen, die man auch vorher hätte lesen können. Andererseits bereue ich das Lesen nicht, da dort viel mehr interessantes stand. Ich sehe auch, dass man nicht erwarten kann, dass alle vorbereitet zum Meeting kommen. Deshalb eine Idee, welche sich vielleicht praktisch umsetzen lässt: Beim Bilden von Untergruppen teilen wir die Leute auf zwischen denen, die zur Vorbereitung gelesen haben, und den anderen. So profitiert man zumindest dadurch von der eigenen Vorbereitung, dass man mit besser informierten Personen diskutieren kann. Ausnahme evtl. für Leute, die zum ersten Mal auftauchen.

> Preconditions to ensure before using the method would be interesting to formalise. A list of common typical cruxes would be nice

> Friendly

> The discussion in the smaller group (though the group was still somewhat big)

> The exercise of fooling an outsider was great! The conclusion to our discussion about cult. It could have been more structured. Maybe with a voting at the end from 1 to 5 how cultish this group is.

> Small discussion group/ n/a

> Most- people least- nothing

> Most: The many views brought about by the different participants. The reading list.
Least: the content felt not cohesive. Some consolidation could help.

> Am Besten die Übung, am wenigsten nichts.

> the structure with 3 levels of preparation was very good idea

> Was fun

Many of us had introductory statistics in college but have forgotten most of
it. For many reasons having a good mastery of statistics is important e.g. to
follow the scientific discourse.

Goal: Achieve mastery of the material covered in a standard "Statistics 101"
college course. Mastery means something a little beyond just being able to
theoretically pass an exam, rather actually getting a good intuitive grasp of
the material.

We are working through the text book "Statistics" by Freedman, Pisani and Purves.

If you are interested in joining the study group please come to a [meetup]({{<

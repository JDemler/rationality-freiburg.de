During the LWCW 2022 there was a great workshop for meetup organizers. The
first exercise was to go through a list of questions and write down your
answers. This was quite revealing for myself because I hadn't explicitly
thought about most of these excellent questions. Here are my answers.

<!--more-->

* **Why did you decide to start doing community organizing?**

Because I felt lonely thinking about the questions I care. I wanted people who
can challenge me and bring new ideas as well as a place to try practices of
instrumental rationality together. A space to teach and to learn.

* **When you started your meetup was there a need you were trying to fill for
  yourself or other people?**

I was mostly trying to fill my own needs. I hope and assume these align with
other people's needs as well.

* **What do you, personally, want out of your community?**

Reliability, commitment, interest, passion, challenges, friendship and
appreciation for my effort.

* **What do you think other people want out of your community?**

Learn new things, share their interests and passions, find like-minded people.

* **What kind of people does your community have?**

Mostly newcomers to _Rationality_, with little prior knowledge. Other than that
a very diverse background. Some people might feel particularly attracted to the
group because so far our main language has been English and I assume
international students in particular are still looking for connections in the
city.

* **What do you see as the point of your community's existence?**

Improve our understanding of the world and helping each other. In the long
term, making the world a better place.

* **Why did you decide to build community around rationality in particular?**

Because I passionately care about truth and understanding.

* **What does the ideal version of your community look like?**

Passionate people who keep coming, are engaged, help each other, take on
responsibility in the group. The group environment should be nice and
comfortable so myself and other attendees look forward to the meetups.

## UPDATE

**IMPORTANT** Please note that due to the rain the event location has changed!
We will monitor the e-mail for at least the first 20 minutes so please write if
you can't find the place info@rationality-freiburg.de

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

## What will we do?

We will **discuss** three posts from the sequence [Noticing
Confusion](https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence) of
[Book I: Map and
Territory](https://www.readthesequences.com/Book-I-Map-And-Territory) of **"The
Sequences"**, a _standard compendium_ of the Rationality community.

* [Focus Your Uncertainty](https://www.readthesequences.com/Focus-Your-Uncertainty)
* [What Is Evidence?](https://www.readthesequences.com/What-Is-Evidence)
* [Scientific Evidence, Legal Evidence, Rational Evidence](https://www.readthesequences.com/Scientific-Evidence-Legal-Evidence-Rational-Evidence)

It would be ideal if you read this beforehand and note your thoughts and
questions, but feel free to turn up even if that is not the case! We will
summarize each post.

Afterwards we will play a round of _Overton Gymnastics_. The goal of this
exercise is becoming more comfortable sharing controversial opinions and
tolerating other people's beliefs without starting a discussion.

_Overton Gymnastics_ is named after the [Overton
window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), a concept from political
science which describes the set of opinions that are acceptable in public
discourse.

One person will share a controversial opinion that they hold, the other
participants will ensure they understand that person's position very well,
culminating in an [ITT (Ideological Turing
Test)](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ideological-turing-tests) i.e. a
convincing summary of the first person's opinion. Then the next participant
shares a controversial opinion of their own. No discussions allowed.

There will be snacks and drinks.

Afterwards we will go and have dinner (and you may engage in the discussions
you were holding back ðŸ˜‰).

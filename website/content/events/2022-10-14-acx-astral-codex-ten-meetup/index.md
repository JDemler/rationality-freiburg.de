## Organization

**UPDATE 29.09** We will meet in "Kursraum 1" of FlexRooms, right next to
Bertholdsbrunnen in the center of Freiburg.

The room has windows to ensure proper ventilation. Masks are optional.

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

Maybe you also want to join the [hike]({{< ref
"/events/2022-10-15-hike-with-karlsruhe-rationality" >}}) on the day after this
event!


## Preparation

Select one or two [SSC (Slate Star Codex)](https://slatestarcodex.com/) or [ACX
(Astral Codex Ten)](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) posts that you
particularly enjoy so you can give a short summary to other participants.

If you need inspiration check the [SSC top
posts](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/).


## What will we do?

First there will be one or several (depending on the number of people) free
discussion rounds where people can present their favorite SSC/ACX posts and the
discussion can flow from there.

After the discussion we will play "The Falling Drill".

One of the most important parts of intellectual progress is learning to change
your mind. The first step of changing your mind is realizing that you were
wrong about something. Today we're going to practice that often painful
realization, in a small way and in a low pressure situation. Without this
skill, how can you debate an important issue or confront a challenging topic?
You might argue long after it's clear to others that you've lost, because
admitting it feels like defeat.

The first lesson any martial artist learns is often how to fall. There are ways
to make the landing easier, but they all start from the knowledge that falling
isn't the worst thing in the world.

There will be snacks and drinks. After the event we will go and get dinner
somewhere.

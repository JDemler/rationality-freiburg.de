## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

The talk will be in English, but questions and feedback can be given in German
as well.

The talk will be until 06:30 pm. Afterwards there is an open discussion and
socializing.


## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Interactive talk on what probabilities are, why they matter and how you can
apply them in your daily life to improve your thinking and make better
decisions.

No mathematical background is required. The goal is to make the subject very
intuitive and simple.

This is a joint event with [EA Freiburg](https://ea-freiburg.org/).

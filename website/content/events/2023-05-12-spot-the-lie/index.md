## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Three people will give a short (10 minute) presentation on an interesting topic
of their choice. In the presentation they will hide 7 things that are false.
The listeners take notes to try to detect these falsehoods.

After each presentation the players in turn explain what they think the lies
were. The presenter can then convince them of the contrary. Presenters get
points for making people believe lies and for making them doubt true facts.
Listeners get points for identifying the lies.

The presenters will get the maximum number of points if each of their lies is
identified by exactly one listener. This way the presenter has an incentive to
make the lies hard but not impossible to spot.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

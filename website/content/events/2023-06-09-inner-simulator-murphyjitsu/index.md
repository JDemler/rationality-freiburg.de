## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

We will explain and discuss the _Inner Simulator_ technique as well as
_Murphyjitsu_ and in pairs try to work through some specific practical
examples. The goal is to make you better at planning.

Inner Simulator is a CFAR technique where you check how surprised you'd be if
you got a particular outcome.
([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inner-simulator-surprise-o-meter)).

In the course of making plans, Murphyjitsu is the practice of strengthening
plans by repeatedly envisioning and defending against failure modes until you
would be shocked to see it fail.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

We will decide on using German or English as the main language depending on the
people who turn up. Just come, we will figure it out!

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

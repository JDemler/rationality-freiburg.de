## Preparation

Some resources you can read beforehand (all in German):

* [Ministerium für Umwelt, Klima und Energiewirtschaft
  Baden-Württemberg](https://um.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/umwelt-natur/naturschutz/biologische-vielfalt/artenschutz/wolf)
* [Forstliche Versuchs- und Forschungsanstalt
  Baden-Württemberg](https://www.fva-bw.de/wolf)
* [Dokumentations- und Beratungsstelle des Bundes zum Thema
  Wolf](https://dbb-wolf.de/)


## What will we do?

Felix Böcker (Head of the Monitoring Division, FVA Wildlife Institute, Lynx and
Wolf Department) will give a talk and answer questions. Afterwards we will
identify some opinions where people differ on this topic and practice "Double
Crux" to identify the roots of the disagreement.

Originally, the wolf was native to the entire Northern Hemisphere. The decline
in habitats and deliberate reduction of populations led to the extinction of
the wolf in large parts of Europe and other continents.

For several decades now, an elevated protection status has enabled the wolf to
reintroduce itself to formerly inhabited regions. In the year 2000, the first
reproduction in Germany was documented once again. Since then, the wolf has
continued to spread in Germany. In 2021/2022, 230 wolf territories were counted
in Germany (Source: DBBW). However, with the return of the wolf and its
scientific monitoring, many aspects and questions have emerged. One of the
primary challenges is livestock farming. Controversies in nature and species
protection also contribute to ongoing discussions in society, for example.

This presentation aims to provide insight into the current state of knowledge
regarding wolf monitoring and to highlight questions and discussions related to
the topic of wolves.

Double crux is an exercise done in pairs where the goal is first to find an
issue where you have a disagreement and then identify the fundamental root
cause of that disagreement.  It's not about confrontation or discussing the
issue, but **collaborating** to find that _crux_ that is making you disagree.
For example two people might disagree on wearing sandals with socks. After some
collaborating they find that the crux of their disagreement is how much
importance they assign to following tacit social norms. They could then dig
even deeper why these social norms are important or why they feel important.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The talk
itself will be in German but we will do live translations as needed.

This meetup will be hosted by Felix.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

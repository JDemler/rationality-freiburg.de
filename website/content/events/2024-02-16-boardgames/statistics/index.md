> die Stimmung + entspannte Atmosphäre

> - das Spielen hat sehr viel Spaß gemacht
> - der Beginn hätte etwas lockerer / gesprächiger sein können

> Was fun

> Viele neue Leute + Spiele kennengelernt

> Was fun to be introduced to new games. 

> Best: Cool games, worst: too much game explanation time due to new players joining in between

> [The game] Karriere Poker

> Most: got to play Scrabble
> least: didn't get to play any new game [Typo fixed]

> Positiv: Mich mal wieder ein bisschen an die Karriere-Poker Strategie erinnern. War leider zu kurz, um komplett rein zu kommen. Insgesamt ist das Feedback-Formular eher unpassend für einen Spieleabend. ;)

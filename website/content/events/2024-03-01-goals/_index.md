## What will we do?

We will discuss the texts linked above. The general topic will be achieving
your goals, procrastination and akrasia. People who have not read the texts
beforehand, will read the first two on-site and only start the discussion
afterwards.

After the discussion, Omar will present the tool
[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) and we will do the "Internal Double
Crux" exercise.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

## What will we do?

A problem that fascinated generations of people. As scientific research evolves
this remains one of the few unanswered questions. We want to give a brief
overview of the stances that science and philosophy have on this elaborate
topic and dive into discussions of all the remaining possibilities and
opinions.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Céline and Nawid.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

**IMPORTANT:** This is a closed meetup, meaning it is only meant for people who
have attended at least ONE previous event. Please do not come if this does not
apply to you! [Why? Read this.]({{< ref "posts/closed-meetups" >}}) Check the
[list of events]({{< ref "events" >}}) to find the next public event, where
everyone is welcome. Anything listed there is 100% open to anyone.


## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

The goal of the meetup is making at least a small improvement in how we think.
We will practice this by reasoning from the ground up about simple physics
problems. I will provide problems with varying difficulty to accomodate people
with different backgrounds. The goal is not learning physics (even though this
might be a side-effect) but becoming better at finding general problem-solving
strategies.

You do not need a physics or math background to attend!

The idea from the meetup is from
[Exercise: Solve "Thinking Physics"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PiPH4gkcMuvLALymK/exercise-solve-thinking-physics).

You can find the book with the exercises on archive.org in multiple formats (e.g. EPUB, PDF):
[Thinking Physics - Practical Lessons In Critical Thinking](https://archive.org/details/ThinkingPhysicsPracticalLessonsInCriticalThinking_201808).

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

### 11. What did you like the most today?

* **Responses:** 13 people (92.86% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Digging really deep into seemingly simple problems with other people was very enjoyable.

> Loved the structuring and that the number of exercises was not too high.

> Super interesting content.  
> Discovered many flaws in my thinking.  
> Physics is cool!

> The discussions with other people who I hadn't met before. The mindbogliness of the questions.

> Very intersting topic. I liked to discover the flaws in my reasoning and thinking strategies. 

> Demonstrated my lack of intuitive, on-hand knowledge of physics and also that given enough time and effort, can understand (most of) it, even from just thinking and mulling over the problem

> Problems 

> Working in smaller groups depending on our level

> The book I got to know. :-)

> Diskussion

> Die Rätsel

> Noticing my own confusion

> Zu erkennen, dass eine gefühlte 80%ige Sicherheit leicht wieder kippen kann, wenn man länger nachdenkt.
### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 8 people (57.14% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Maybe spend slightly more time on the solutions.

> Nothing. 

> Very Minor: didn't explicitly include "some ways to problem solve" except what came up during discussion. E.g. maybe one attempt without any such discussion and then one attempt after discussing such approaches. But then, would have had time crunch

> Problems

> The long discussion at the end about the details of a problem that has not been discussed/looked into in our group

> /

> Nichts

> Drinking water color [The tap water at the location was yellowish, which had never happened before]

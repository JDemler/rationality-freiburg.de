Background: [ACX (Astral Codex Ten)](https://www.astralcodexten.com) is a blog
by Scott Alexander. Once a year he announces "Meetups Everywhere" where fans of
the blog get together. Please join even if you are not (yet) a fan!


## What will we do?

We will form multiple small groups and discuss the texts proposed above and see
where the conversation takes us. There will be at least one discussion group
with no specific starting topic for people who did not prepare a text
beforehand.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

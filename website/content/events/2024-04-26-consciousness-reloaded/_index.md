**IMPORTANT:** This is a closed meetup, meaning it is only meant for people who
have attended at least ONE previous event. Please do not come if this does not
apply to you! [Why? Read this.]({{< ref "posts/closed-meetups" >}}) Check the
[list of events]({{< ref "events" >}}) to find the next public event, where
everyone is welcome. Anything listed there is 100% open to anyone.


## Preparation

To be defined.


## What will we do?

After our last meetup on [consciousness]({{< ref
"events/2024-03-15-consciousness" >}}) there was a lot of interest in continuing
the philosophical discussions. Nawid will give some impulses and we will dive
right in.

Having attended the previous meetup on consciousness is not a prerequisite
(however, you do need to have attended at least one previous meetup on any
topic, see the note at the top).


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Nawid.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

## Preparation

Write to the organizers (info@rationality-freiburg.de) if you have a topic you
would like to to a lightning discussion about. You'll get to present the topic
in 2-3 minutes and then there will be 15-20 minutes of discussion.


## What will we do?

Short discussion rounds on a variety of topics. I stole the idea from [Chicago
Rationality](https://chicagorationality.com/meetups/october-meetup-lightning-discussions/).


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

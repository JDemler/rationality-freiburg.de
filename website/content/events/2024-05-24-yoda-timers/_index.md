**IMPORTANT:** This is a closed meetup, meaning it is only meant for people who
have attended at least ONE previous event. Please do not come if this does not
apply to you! [Why? Read this.]({{< ref "posts/closed-meetups" >}}) Check the
[list of events]({{< ref "events" >}}) to find the next public event, where
everyone is welcome. Anything listed there is 100% open to anyone.


## Preparation

Bring a **laptop** (simply because some tasks are much easier to accomplish
with a laptop). If you can't, don't worry, come without.

Optional (content will be explained during the meetup):

- [Hammertime Day 2: Yoda Timers](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj/p/vpvKEj7shuk8h5Eet)
- [Resolve Cycles](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jiJquD34sa9Lyo5wc/resolve-cycles)


## What will we do?

Resolve Cycles (or the cooler sounding "Yoda Timers", as alkjash calls them) is
a CFAR technique that sounds trivial and yet is quite effective: Pick something
that you want to do do but feel inner resistance against doing, set a timer for
5 minutes and do it. Not just develop a plan or whatever, but actually finish
it in those 5 minutes.

I will explain the reasoning and the technique. Then we will actually try it
out (bring a laptop if possible) and finally we'll discuss how it went and
future application.

Those that read the above articles and/or feel confident with the technique
will be able to skip my introduction and get to work directly in their own
sub-group.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

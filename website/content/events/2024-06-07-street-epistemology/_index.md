## Preparation

SE stands for Street Epistemology.

## What will we do?

> Street Epistemology is a way of applying a set of philosophy and
psychology-based tools through civil conversation to help ourselves and others
critically reflect on the quality of the reasoning one uses to justify their
level of confidence that a claim is true.

We will watch a talk introducing SE, try the technique out in pairs and finally
discuss our thoughts, future application etc.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

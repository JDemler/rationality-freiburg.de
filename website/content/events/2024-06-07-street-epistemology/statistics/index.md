### 11. What did you like the most today?

* **Responses:** 4 people (44.44% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> How hard and yet possibly useful SE is. Also the video was good. The exercise with climate change belief was great as it was directionally aligned with my bias and so was hard and made me think.

> Interesting topic 

> The discussion 

> Practical part
### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 4 people (44.44% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> 45 mins felt long at the start but the video was engaging and stood well; could see some other vids not working well for the purpose. Maybe <25 min of content would be good

> Might have been helpful to provide some example beliefs/topics to use for the practical part of street epistemology. Or ask people to find a topic at home on beforehand. 

> Not enough time for the practical exercise.

> Viel zu wenig Zeit zum Üben. Aber ich habe auch keine Idee, wie man das realistisch hätte verbessern können. _Wenn_ wir mehr Zeit zum Üben gehabt hätten (oder aber eine ungerade Zahl gewesen wären), hätte man auch Dreiergruppen bilden können: Die dritte Person beobachtet nur und schreibt auf, was man hätte verbessern können.

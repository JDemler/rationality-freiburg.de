## Preparation

Optional:

* Read the game
  [description](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nNYq8g6MAq6bmyKTB/rationality-taboo-the-game).


## What will we do?

The skill of Rationality Taboo is in being able to describe a concept without
use of that word or any of its short synonyms. It is sometimes used to avoid
arguments over definition, where two sides of a dispute are using a word
differently. (“If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, does it make a
sound?” “What do you mean by ‘sound’ exactly?”) This skill got its name from
the game “Taboo” which does exactly that, with a list of common words and their
obvious substitutions. The game of Rationality Taboo is played with slight
variations and with less common words. How do you explain “Bayesian Update”
without saying “Prior” or “Probable” or “Change”?

We will play multiple rounds of the game in subgroups. Don't worry if you don't
know know all the _fancy rationality concepts_ since you'll be able to choose
which concepts to explain and I'll include enough common ones.

At the end we'll have a short group discussion on the purpose and usefulness of
the exercise.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

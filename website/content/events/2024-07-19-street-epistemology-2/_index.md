**IMPORTANT:** This is a closed meetup, meaning it is only meant for people who
have attended at least ONE previous event. Please do not come if this does not
apply to you! [Why? Read this.]({{< ref "posts/closed-meetups" >}}) Check the
[list of events]({{< ref "events" >}}) to find the next public event, where
everyone is welcome. Anything listed there is 100% open to anyone.

## Preparation

SE stands for Street Epistemology.

**IMPORTANT:** During the previous [SE event]({{< ref "events/2024-06-07-street-epistemology" >}}) several people expressed the wish
to get more practice. We do not have time to re-introduce the entire topic so
preparing at home is essential! Calculate 2 hours of preparation time and
please do not leave it until the last day.

If you did not attend the previous [SE event]({{< ref "events/2024-06-07-street-epistemology" >}}) watch the first 49 minutes (until
the audience questions) from the following video: [Learn Street Epistemology:
Assumptions | Elements | Recovery (Oslo 2018) (blue
slides)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB-HKbtUdzM)

In addition, **everyone** must read sections 4 and 5 (i.e. pages 11 to 20) of
the following document [The Complete Street Epistemology Guide - How to Talk
About
Beliefs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/The_Complete_Street_Epistemology_Guide_-_1st_Edition.pdf)
(PDF).

If you read the entire document and/or consume additional resources on the
topic of SE, even better! Two names you can search on YouTube are Anthony
Magnabosco and Peter Boghossian.


## What will we do?

We will put SE into practice in pairs, depending on the number of attendees
with an additional _observer_ per pair that gives feedback. We will rotate the
roles and mix the pairs during the evening.

At the end we will have a short discussion round.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

The goal of the meetup is making at least a small improvement in how we think.
We will practice this by reasoning from the ground up about simple physics
problems. I will provide problems with varying difficulty to accomodate people
with different backgrounds. The goal is not learning physics (even though this
might be a side-effect) but becoming better at finding general problem-solving
strategies.

You do not need a physics or math background to attend!

This is the second run of a [previous event]({{< ref "events/2024-03-29-thinking-physics" >}}) that was well received.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.

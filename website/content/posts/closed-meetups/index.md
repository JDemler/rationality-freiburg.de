summary: Announcement that we will sometimes have closed meetups that are not
  open to newcomers. Normal meetups open to everyone will keep happening!
---

The meetups are growing and in in the first 2 months of 2024 we are already
averaging over 18 people per meetup. This is fantastic since we love having new
people! On average there are 2 newcomers at every meetup.

At the same time us, the people who have been coming to these meetups on a
regular basis for a year or more, feel that sometimes they are becoming too big
too fast and that we will not be able to retain the level of comfort and trust
that we cherish.

For this reason we have decided to start having closed meetups that are not
open to newcomers. **Anyone** who has been to a **previous meetup** is welcome
to join these closed meetups!  The **normal meetups**, where we welcome **new
people** with open arms, **will keep happening nonetheless!**

How can you tell the difference? **Closed meetups will not be announced
online.** So, if you find an event on this website or meetup.com, please come
whether you are new or not!

The purpose of the wide end of a funnel is to catch as much liquid as possible
without spillage. The same way, our meetups can be seen as events where we want
to catch as many people as possible that might potentially be a good match for
our goals.

This post is a counter proposal to ['Our Social Contract']({{< ref
"posts/our-social-contract" >}}).

During the latest meetup as part of the Hamming circle I presented my struggles
finding the best way to achieve my goals with this group. These goals are
finding a group of people that inspires me and each other. That make me
question things I was convinced of and make me grow and improve.

This was of course, related to the ongoing debate over the lasts weeks
triggered before but mostly fueled by 'Our Social Contract'.

The prevailing fear of opponents of those strict rules is that they will be
offputting to people who would otherwise be a good fit for the group. Also,
some people quoted the "A Fine is a Price" paper (Israeli daycare center where
the number of latecomers increased after introducing a monetary fine), possibly
most well known because it's mentioned in "Thinking, Fast and Slow".

So here goes another proposal.

* Have two kinds of meetups, public ones and private ones
* The public meetups have lax rules
* The private meetups have strict attendance requirements

The public meetups are the funnel that attract new, potentially interesting and
interested people.

The private meetups are the _Rationality Dojo_ that focuses on doing intense
work together, with trust and empathy.

The idea of dividing the events in such a way comes from the Berlin group where
this is how they have been doing it for many years. Here is a description of
the [Berlin Rationality
Dojo](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XNWKkb7XtEXi6HWEG/rationality-dojo-berlin-handout).

# Public Meetup Rules

* **Punctuality**: The arrival window starts at 10 minutes before the official
  start and ends 15 minutes after. For example if the official start time is
  18:00 pm then you can arrive between 17:50 pm and 18:15 pm. You are free to
  arrive at any time during this period. If you come later than that, be aware
  that you are hurting the atmosphere of trust and commitment that we create at
  the start of the meetup and consider carefully whether you want to do that.
* **Preparation**: Frequently we have some reading or similar to prepare for
  the meetup. The quality of the discussion or exercises suffer significantly
  when some participants do not prepare. Therefore, we ask you to carefully
  consider whether you want to come unprepared.
* **Chatham House Rule**: Participants are free to use the information received
  during the meetup, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the
  speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed. [More
  details](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule).

# Private _Rationality Dojo_ Rules

* The _Public Meeting Rules_ apply
* Participation is only possible via invitation. The events are not public and
  are not publicly announced.
* New participants must have attended at least one public meetup or come with a
  personal recommendation by at least one existing participant.
* New participants must be announced beforehand and can't be brought without
  prior agreement.
* Any existing participant can veto a new participant.
* There is a general expectation of commitment and taking these meetings
  seriously. Aim to contribute as much as you take from the gatherings.

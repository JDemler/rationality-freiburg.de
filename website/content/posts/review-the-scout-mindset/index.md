I am worried. The book is fabulous! Does that seem like a contradiction? I am
afraid I won't be able to do it justice and put you off reading it. And I fear
you'll think a short summary is enough for you.

The Scout Mindset is one of those books that would truly benefit everyone if
they read it. It could make a real improvement to the world, even if people
would only remember 2% of its content after a few months, as is probably the
case.

Julia Galef is an excellent communicator, as she has proven time and again in
her podcast "Rationally Speaking" or her many other enterprises. She is able to
condense complex subjects and ask just the right questions to give the
reader/listener/interviewee a good understanding and a good experience. And she
always seems happy and positive, never cynical.

The book opens with the story of the Dreyfus affair in France in the 19th (?)
century. One police officer, who personally was opposed to Dreyfus on account
of his jewishness started noticing discrepancies in the case against him and
felt the need to pursue the truth and ultimately exonerate Dreyfus. This is her
first example of the "scout mindset" i.e. the desire to see the world as it
really is. And the Dreyfus anecdote also shows what I most liked about the
book! It is one story after another. For every theoretical concept she shows
practical applications and examples. This makes the lecture entertaining and
strengthens the case she is trying to make.



I look forward to re-reading the book many times!

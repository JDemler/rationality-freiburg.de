## Feedback

After (almost) every event I collected feedback from people. Here is just a
list of things people have said, without any context. Is this useful? Possibly
not, but it might give a general impression whether people enjoy coming (they
do!). It was also noted a few times that negative feedback actually lead to
changes, which was appreciated by participants. If after a feedback it says x3
it means 3 people reported the same.


* The discussion went off rails at times. The discussion group was too big.
  [Solution: Split the group] x3

* Having such a discussion in English is hard. [Solution: Split the group into
  German and English]

* Having a public feedback round is not so great. [Solution: Distribute paper
  for written feedback]

* Doing something hands-on was very nice.

* The meeting place was great [Stadtgarten].

* I liked the playful character of the calibration game.

* We should keep some instrumental rationality in every meetup.

* Very well prepared, with Snacks etc.

* Discussions need to start off a common ground. People may have very different
  knowledge. Today it was good.

* A lot of fun.

* Good balance of moderation/leading the discussion and letting people discuss
  by Omar.

* There was little time to do the Double Crux.

* People came a little late, which initially left me fearing that nobody would
  come.

* Double Crux does not work well with 3 persons.

* Everyone felt that it was a useful technique and that we should do it again
  in the future.

* The group size was ideal.

* Practical exercises were very good.

* We did not discuss one of the posts that we wanted to and instead went off
  topic. We should try to stick to our plan.

* I liked your and X’s contributions a lot and most other people were good too.
  One person was terrible and I don’t know how to manage people like that, I
  think you did your best. I liked everyone else. The structure was pretty good
  and your moderating was pretty good, I’d just echo what other people said
  about time allocation.

* Overton Gymnastics is a good exercise!

* Very interesting to see a meetup with people who are all quite new to
  rationality!

* The game [exercise] was not well explained at all!!

* I found the Sequences posts rather boring / not super interesting.

* I'm not sure if having newbies to rationality in the group is a good idea.

* Maybe more moderation?

* Great seeing all of you again!

* Happy to again exchange thoughts with all of you.

* The dynamic of the discussion round was not ideal this time.

* Not enough air circulation [because of COVID].

* We should allocate fixed time slots to every post [to avoid the discussion
  getting too deep into other subjects].

* The group was too large [10 people] for one discussion round.

* Discussing three posts [as we did] and not more is ideal.

* We should have split into two groups of five people.

* There was not enough time for the exercise. The discussion should only take
  up half the time.

* Please arrive 5 minutes before the start to avoid the entire session starting
  15 minutes late.

* 5 people group size is good. x2

* Prediction game. Manifold Markets. The chosen questions. All very nice.

* Well organized.

* Interesting experience. I will come back. I was irritated by the music
  [coming in through the windows from the street]. The UI from Manifold Markets
  is confusing and I won't be using it. 2 hours was too short for the event.

* I was missing a little more "instrumental rationality" e.g. TAPs.

* Giving a short summary of every text is a good custom that we should keep up
  [we did not do it this time] for people who have not read the texts. One
  person is responsible.

* The goal of the meetup was unclear beforehand. I was unaware it was so
  formal.  It would have been better to arrive on time. If you host such a
  structured meetup it would be better to go all the way and make it even more
  formal.  Having conversations about [ACX] posts would happen naturally during
  dinner anyway.

* I really liked the meetup.

* The exercise was weird.

* I really liked the summaries of the ACX posts.

* Thank you for organizing this. I appreciate very much how serious you take
  feedback and how attentive you are as a organizer by adapting the meetup
  according to it. There is however a risk that catering too much to the
  participants could lead to stagnation of the group. Nevertheless, trying to
  keep things in flux (for better or worse) is a great quality for an organizer
  and is better than sticking only with one formula.

* It was my first time in the group. I think it is very unusual to find people
  who try to do such exercises to improve themselves. The exercise [falling
  drill] was not very effective because it was clear that it was only a
  simulation.

* During the exercise [falling drill] I was in fact wrong about something where
  in fact I thought I would be right. That was unexpected, but it was very easy
  for me to admit this and that is unusual. Usually it's hard for me to admit a
  mistake, but I felt comfortable doing it in this group.

* During the first part of the meetup it would have been better to go deeper
  into one or two ACX posts instead of briefly presenting one per person.

* I will return!

* It was my first time and the first round [discussing ACX posts] was great! It
  gave me new things to consider that I had never thought about. Concerning the
  game [falling drill] I already train being able to be wrong a lot so I
  probably fail more often in the opposite direction [being too unsure], so it
  wasn't very effective for me.

* The setting was too artificial for the game [falling drill].

* I really appreciate your [organizer's] work. We should have spent more time
  on the first round [discussing ACX posts]. It was too short.

* Forming two groups of 5-6 people was great! The perfect size. In bigger
  groups people get lost.

* It was a very nice way of spending the evening.

* I am blown away by the effort you invested in preparing this.

* The accoustics of the room were annoying.

* The group size was ideal.

* The exercise [falling drill] would work better if you had to give confidence
  intervals and could be criticized for choosing those badly.

* Best: Hike on the next day.

* Best: Getting to know new people and discussing our favourite posts from the
  ACX/SSC blogs.

* Best: Discussing our favourite articles by Scott, and also the hike on the
  day after.

* Best: The sheer number of new, astonishing insights.

* Best: Level of conversation was high.

* Best: Improving my ability to say out loud when I'm wrong, without feeling
  bad about it.

* Worst: The room.

* Worst: Felt a tiny(!) bit cultish.

* Worst: Disturbing political opinions.

* Worst: The location was uninspiring.

* Worst: The room had bad accoustics.

* I don’t like going to restaurants that much, it’s much more expensive than
  what I usually spend on food.

* Less structured meetings or a way to branch ideas into spin-off
  collaborations in a structured context might make me more excited to come.

* Omar is cool. He’s a little obsessed with perfection. He needs to loosen up a
  bit. These things take time to grow.

* Interesting concepts shared. Rationality is certainly a toolkit that can be
  applied in everything and can benefit many people and a lot of lives. But
  it’s not universally seen as a good because it’s a competitor to many classic
  frameworks like organized religion. So developing a model that competes on
  the same playing field is tough.

* The exercise [Hamming circle] was probably helpful for an issue I have been
  thinking about for several years.

* I was not so happy that only four people came.

* What you [the organizer] are doing here is really valuable.

* I enjoyed the exercise [Hamming circle]. It made me make up my mind.

* We should keep the exercise part of the meetup.

* I really enjoyed it.

* I liked the Hamming circle very much. Especially having to turn around while
  the advisors were discussing, something which I had anticipated I wouldn't
  like.

* The discussion round about "Trusting experts" didn't get to the core of the
  issue. It would have required drawing on the whiteboard and a couple of hours
  of time.

* Acoustics of the room were great.

* TAPs was interesting.

* Getting to know cool people.

* I didn't get Occam's razor.

* Lack of structure and bad time allocation.

* Valuable meeting.

* I liked the mix of discussions and practical things.

* I liked both parts.

* Very nice joint event [with EA Freiburg].

* I learnt something. x2

* Nice mix of input and exercises.

* I am glad it was so interactive.

* Interesting. It took longer than expected to get into the subject [long
  introduction]. I liked it.

* I liked the refreshed [on probability theory]. Took too long to get started.
  It would have been better to define some terms and present a clear agenda for
  the evening upfront.

* I liked it. It was a good refresher. I was missing a little the "how to apply
  it" part.

* Good mix of presentation and exercises. Good refresher.

* Fun and interesting.

* The content of the talk has good applicability to life.

* Considering the prior probability of events before evaluating the evidence
  was something I had not thought about before.

* I have a better understanding of Bayes' theorem now.

* Timing was not optimal. It would have been better to have more time to think
  about a strategy for the Poker game.

* I realized that I do not think enough about priors.

* You should have focused a little bit more about why our intuition fails us
  and how to come to a better intuitive grasp of these concepts.

* It opened new perspectives.

* The talk was well prepared.

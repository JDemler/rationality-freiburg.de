**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

### 12. What did you like the least?

* **Responses:** 32 people (28.32% of attendees)

**Note:** Anything contained in square brackets [] is an edit by the organizers.

> Schade war, dass viel Zeit daf√ºr verwendet wurde Dinge zu wiederholen, die man auch vorher h√§tte lesen k√∂nnen. Andererseits bereue ich das Lesen nicht, da dort viel mehr interessantes stand. Ich sehe auch, dass man nicht erwarten kann, dass alle vorbereitet zum Meeting kommen. Deshalb eine Idee, welche sich vielleicht praktisch umsetzen l√§sst: Beim Bilden von Untergruppen teilen wir die Leute auf zwischen denen, die zur Vorbereitung gelesen haben, und den anderen. So profitiert man zumindest dadurch von der eigenen Vorbereitung, dass man mit besser informierten Personen diskutieren kann. Ausnahme evtl. f√ºr Leute, die zum ersten Mal auftauchen.

> The conclusion to our discussion about cult. It could have been more structured. Maybe with a voting at the end from 1 to 5 how cultish this group is.

> nothing

> The content felt not cohesive. Some consolidation could help.

> Nichts

> - der Beginn h√§tte etwas lockerer / gespr√§chiger sein k√∂nnen

> too much game explanation time due to new players joining in between

> Didn't get to play any new game [Typo fixed]

> Insgesamt ist das Feedback-Formular eher unpassend f√ºr einen Spieleabend. ;)

> Exercise

> Die Diskussionen und √ºbung h√§tten inhaltlich noch etwas spannendere Argumente bringen k√∂nnen, aber das ist halt nicht immer gleich.

> Exercise was quite hard.

> I was not prepared

> snacks :-D [This is an inside joke since some participants would like to snack less.]

> Many discussions in offtopic examples. Low abstraction level.

> less time

> A little bit chaotic today, longer discussion in small groups would have nice, clear definition of consciousness was not given

> First part didn't really 'introduced' what was then presented by Nawid. Felt a bit irrelevant for the discussion part.

> I think some parts of the presentations were not really relevant for the topic.

> Will wasn't fully clear about the arguments are the end. But might just need to think more about it.

> Mehr Zeit, um tiefer in die Diskussion zu gehen w√§re gut

> Time management

> I would have preferred more time for discussions, maybe by splitting up the content into several Meetups.

> The discussion is not structured or guided.

> Maybe spend slightly more time on the solutions.

> Nothing. 

> Very Minor: didn't explicitly include "some ways to problem solve" except what came up during discussion. E.g. maybe one attempt without any such discussion and then one attempt after discussing such approaches. But then, would have had time crunch

> Problems

> The long discussion at the end about the details of a problem that has not been discussed/looked into in our group

> /

> Nichts

> Drinking water color [The tap water at the location was yellowish, which had never happened before]

> I liked the â€žmake the elephants like each other ideaâ€œ

> Schade war, dass viel Zeit dafÃ¼r verwendet wurde Dinge zu wiederholen, die man auch vorher hÃ¤tte lesen kÃ¶nnen. Andererseits bereue ich das Lesen nicht, da dort viel mehr interessantes stand. Ich sehe auch, dass man nicht erwarten kann, dass alle vorbereitet zum Meeting kommen. Deshalb eine Idee, welche sich vielleicht praktisch umsetzen lÃ¤sst: Beim Bilden von Untergruppen teilen wir die Leute auf zwischen denen, die zur Vorbereitung gelesen haben, und den anderen. So profitiert man zumindest dadurch von der eigenen Vorbereitung, dass man mit besser informierten Personen diskutieren kann. Ausnahme evtl. fÃ¼r Leute, die zum ersten Mal auftauchen.

> Preconditions to ensure before using the method would be interesting to formalise. A list of common typical cruxes would be nice

> Friendly

> The discussion in the smaller group (though the group was still somewhat big)

> The exercise of fooling an outsider was great! The conclusion to our discussion about cult. It could have been more structured. Maybe with a voting at the end from 1 to 5 how cultish this group is.

> Small discussion group/ n/a

> Most- people least- nothing

> Most: The many views brought about by the different participants. The reading list.
> Least: the content felt not cohesive. Some consolidation could help.

> Am Besten die Ãœbung, am wenigsten nichts.

> the structure with 3 levels of preparation was very good idea

> Was fun

> die Stimmung + entspannte AtmosphÃ¤re

> - das Spielen hat sehr viel SpaÃŸ gemacht
> - der Beginn hÃ¤tte etwas lockerer / gesprÃ¤chiger sein kÃ¶nnen

> Was fun

> Viele neue Leute + Spiele kennengelernt

> Was fun to be introduced to new games. 

> Best: Cool games, worst: too much game explanation time due to new players joining in between

> [The game] Karriere Poker

> Most: got to play Scrabble
> least: didn't get to play any new game [Typo fixed]

> Positiv: Mich mal wieder ein bisschen an die Karriere-Poker Strategie erinnern. War leider zu kurz, um komplett rein zu kommen. Insgesamt ist das Feedback-Formular eher unpassend fÃ¼r einen Spieleabend. ;)

> New room was great!

> Es gab eine sehr gute Balance zwischen Diskussion, Input und Ãœbungen.
> Die Triviafragen waren eine gute Idee, aber auch etwas stressig ðŸ˜„

> Texts
> Exercise

> New room is nice!

> Der groÃŸe Raum war gut (wenn auch etwas kalt). Die Diskussionen und Ã¼bung hÃ¤tten inhaltlich noch etwas spannendere Argumente bringen kÃ¶nnen, aber das ist halt nicht immer gleich. 

> discussions

> Der Raum war schÃ¶n groÃŸ.

> I enjoyed the big group discussion about procrastination.

> Discussion was great.
> Exercise was quite hard.

> Most topic least I was not prepared 

> Room 10/10
> 
> We have space for some movement excersices there maybe. Like arranging in order of attribute of person for introduction 

> discussions + exercise
> snacks :-D

> Least: Many discussions in offtopic examples. Low abstraction level.
